## SMS Ocx


</div>

### Description

It´s an ocx that takes plain text and outputs MSCOMM compatable code for direct sending to a ground SMSC.
 
### More Info
 
This is a hurried code, not really optimized or anything, it was ripped from another project of mine, mainly to provide a transport for the OCX that is the main thing, all you really need to send SMS's now is your local groundstation SMSC telephone number, and MS Knowledgebase article on the MSComm control.

(There are some unneded fragments of code, but the main ones should be fairly well rem'd)

None (Known:)
